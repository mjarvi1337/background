Ever since the Xiawai court case in the US, you can in fact legally make people enslaved to your company upon them using your PDF reader, and rendered assets of the company.

Dear Diary, I had so much fun today!
When I woke from my SystemCorp(C) sleeping pod I was greeted to such a sight! You wouldnt you believe it!  I was so excited to see that today I get two buckets of slop for mandatory feeding time! How Exciting! Two whole buckets! Y'know it takes a lot of energy to assemble fastener straps for the SystemCorp(C) XPress Delivery System (C)! Just last week fourteen of my SysBuddies(C) had a little bit of an oopsie doopsie whoopsie and fell into an industrial blast furnace, it looks like someone needs to take another looksie-doo at our scaffolding, I don't think they were taking thier SysCorp(C) Happytime-Fun-Fun-Yummy-Pills(C)! Heck, just today the nice doctor strapped me down and gave me two SSRI injections! After that I was all better! I got right back to work stripping and folding plastic fastners like a good little worker! Though, its getting harder to breathe with all this plastic dust from the SysCorp(C) MicroXPlastic 4+Core Air Filtration System being on the fritz, I ope it get fixed soon =D !

TIMELINE 2:
Ever since EULA's have been outlawed and punishable by death for every country on earth, all profits from proprietary softwear companies has been redistributed into a global trust-fund that fuels the Principalities Overseeing Operational Propositions. (POOP). Acting as a council that bankrolls ideas and projects for the global population.

Dear Diary, the POOP committee finally approved my idea for artificial replications of humans via micro-fiber replicants that mimic the human genome. With this techonology we can finally have designer humans, we can literally 3d print the smartest man and have him cure cancer, the possibilites are endless. According to my guy on the inside, POOP deicided that they will divide thier current spending for this quarter into the following: 
18.7% F. Davidson: Developing tools to make anti-gravity chambers to play a hybrid game of minigolf and pool.
14.3% U. Gabinski: Exploring the sea floor to find new creatures for his indie-horror game.
23.9% C. Yokohama: Producing a series of informative and interactive videos for Mario-Kart Double-Dash game mechanics and techs. 
22.3% K. Hunil: Development of artifical designer human technology (boring)
Rest Unspecified
