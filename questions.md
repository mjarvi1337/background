What do open-source EULAS look like?

Something that I missed from my presentation were Open source softwear lisences (OSSL'S), these are the lisences that come with open source softwear. What distinccts the two? This lenthy paragraph from https://nest.com/legal/eula/ answers the question from a legal stantpoint:
	"Certain items of software included with the Product Software are subject to “open source” or “free software” licenses (“Open Source Software”). Some of the Open Source Software is owned by third parties. The Open Source Software is not subject to the terms and conditions of this EULA. Instead, each item of Open Source Software is licensed under the terms of the end user license that accompanies such Open Source Software. Nothing in this EULA limits your rights under, or grants you rights that supersede, the terms and conditions of any applicable end user license for the Open Source Software. If required by any license for particular Open Source Software, Nest Labs makes such Open Source Software, and Nest Labs’ modifications to that Open Source Software, available by written request to Nest Labs at the email or mailing address listed below."
	To summarize, the main difference is that the OSSL applies to the product produced by the softwear. Where EULA's care about the softwear, and don't care what comes from the softwear. 

So what is in the OSSL's?
	According to https://opensource.com/open-source-way OSSL's carry a philopsohy with it, to ummarize:
    
 Having all the sources of the softwear available for anyone to modify, to encourage community work, with free modification of any part of the softwear at any time. Within the community, having work be evulated fairly and in a system based on merit and skill of developing.
	Because of the philosophy of open source, it's often framed as "heres what you CAN do with it". as opposed to "heres what you CAN'T do with it." 


How do EULAS hold in the court?

I know court cases and VERY entertaining and not at all boring as shit to read though, so to save you some time i'll give the simplifed versions of some court cased envolving EULA's

Jacobson V Katzer: https://caselaw.findlaw.com/us-federal-circuit/1189790.html
This one has to do with the legality of copyright and OSSL's in regards to model trains.

Jacobson manages a program called Java Model Railroad Interface (JRMI) which made a program called DecoderPro, which allows users to program the decoder chips of model trains (facinating stuff). 
Katzer created a similar program called DecoderCOmmander which has similar fucntions to DecoderPro.
Jacobson claims that Katzer used parts of DecoderPro to make DecoderCommander, without abiding to the artistic lisence of DecoderPro. The court found that the artistic lisence was "intentionally broad, nonexclusive" which did not create reason for copyright infringement.

ARCA v Lexmark: https://caselaw.findlaw.com/us-9th-circuit/1261937.html
The Arizona Cartridge case was one that confirmed that clauses of EULA's can be enforced in the court of law. The case goes that Arizona Cartridge Remanufactures Association (ARCA) claimed that the printer cartridge Lexmark had violated consumer's rights by having a shrinkwrap agreement that made it so that consumers HAD to return the used cartridge to Lexmark for recycling or remanufacturing, a stratigy to compete with re-manufacuturers stock. The court found that consumers agree to the shrinkwrap agreement, and should return the cartridges back to Lexmark.
