What the hell is An EULA?
An EULA (End User License Agreement) is the legally binding contract you agree to when obtaining a license to use a program. When you acquire software and agree to the EULA, you do not own the software, you instead have a license to use the software from the company that made the product. When you rent or lease something from someone, there’s going to be terms and conditions that apply. But when you buy something to own it you can do whatever you want with it, you don’t buy software, you effectively lease it forever.  

Why is it so damn long?
Given that EULAs function as a way to inform the consumer of all the things that they cannot do with the program, companies like to keep it as inaccessible as possible. These documents are so long and packed to the brim with legal jargon because lawyers know that they can put in as much filibuster as they want to distract the consumer. Usually all these layers of words are to get to the point of “don't sue us”. 

Where did they come from?
	Because of copyright laws, EULAs are required for installation of software made by other people. Though today EULAs are a digital contract, there have been other iterations of this. Shrink-wrap contracts is a license document that would be on the outside of a physical box, that had a physical copy of the softwear; with similarly ridiculous and unreadable contracts. 

What is open source software?
	For the most part you probably use Proprietary software, this is where one entity has control over the rights of the software. Open source software is software that is far less restrictive when it comes to what you as a consumer can and cannot do to softwear. One of the main clauses that shows up the most in a lot of EULAs are modification statements: “Don’t modify this.” “Open-source” refers to the source code, the code that makes the program, and open-source programs have their code. 
	
Do EULAs even work?
	For the most part EULAs aren't even enforced, they function more as a scare tactic to unknowing consumers. It’s not a question of what you can’t do, it's what the companies can’t do. People regularly break EULAs with things like game modifications, data mining and pirating, the worst you're going to get is a cease and desist letter to an individual person. 

Can they do whatever they want?
	As far as what the company that produced can do, technically they can say whatever they want and if you agreed you agreed. But that's only what the company said, laws are different all throughout the world. An EULA with a clause of “You can’t criticize this program.” is in direct conflict with the first amendment in the United States. This type of clause is usually used as a way to make empty threats at smaller people/groups who cannot afford the time and money for a legal battle with some dickhead developer.

Sneaky legal stuff
	Most software is spyware and its totally legal ¯\_(ツ)_/¯
